              This is Raqib Nur, a Web Application Developer residing in Dhaka,
              Bangladesh. Even if it sounds humorous, I went to Madrasa and
              returned as a programmer! âœŒ<br />
              <br />I consider myself to be completely blessed as I get to
              inspect and build websites for a living. Of my intense interest in
              the Web Platform &amp; SaaS products, I plan to build
              results-driven digital products for my clients while becoming part
              of meaningful businesses along the way.
              <br />
              <br />I{"'"}ve built numerous websites and worked closely with the
              founders of the companies. Besides, I{"'"}ve also committed my
              time to 3 companies part-time to help them hire and manage their
              own technical team, and I am here today to become a part of your
              journey.
              <br />
              <br />
              Recently, I{"'"}ve co-founded an eCommerce Development Company:
              The Run Digital, where we help entrepreneurs fix their web goals
              and help them achieve them with our web-based solutions. We are,
              after all, KP-Idriven.
